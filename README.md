# telemedicine_app

**What It Is**

A simple application that allows users register as doctors or patients.

Patients can make appointments with doctors as long as its within the doctors available time.



**What It's Not**

-  The app is not containerized with Docker Compose (for now).
- Testing should not be from a browser because of cors restrictions (for now).
